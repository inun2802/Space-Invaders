# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders is a “fixed shooter” game where the player moves across the screen horizontally and fights off hordes of aliens.
The player must avoid enemy fire while shooting at aliens. The player must act fast against the enemies or else
their shields will be gone which makes them more vulnerable to death. The player
only gets three lives to beat the level. To control your spaceship, press the left and
right arrow keys. To shoot, press the spacebar or click. The goal of this game was
to improve our skills within unity and to make a challenging, fun to play game, as
well as implementing a great/smooth UI. 

Space Invaders is jam packed with a gaming experience with various features including
easy and hard modes, score tracking, and enemy aliens to combat. Our final goal was to
make sure a rule-based system, evaluating its variable and quantifiable outcomes,
different values attributed to outcomes, player effort requirement, emotional
attachment elicited from players, and negotiable consequences of gameplay were all
included to make sure the game was complete and most importantly, fun and
challenging for the Player.

1. Win and Loss Conditions
● The win condition is achieved by defeating all enemies in each level,
leading to progression to the next level.
● The loss condition occurs if the player's spaceship collides with an enemy
or enemy projectile, resulting in the loss of a life. The game ends if the
player loses all three lives.
● Feedback for the player includes visual cues such as a "Game Over" screen
for a loss and progression to the next level for a win.
2. Saving and Loading
● The game supports saving and loading of player progress, including level
completion and settings such as volume adjustments.
3. Sound:
● Sound effects are implemented throughout the game, including
background music, shooting sounds, collision sounds, and other relevant
audio feedback.
4. Settings:
● Settings menu allows players to adjust volume levels for music and sound
effects to their preference.
5. Instructions:
● In-game instructions are provided within the main menu, informing
players of the controls and objectives of the game without requiring access
to outside documentation.
6. Decisions for the Player:
● The mystery ship mechanic presents an interesting decision for the player.
Shooting the mystery ship may trigger a special event or access to a secret
level, providing an additional challenge and reward for skilled players.
● It ensures that the game maintains an appropriate level of challenge for
players, keeping them engaged without becoming frustratingly difficult or
too easy. Each player's experience is tailored to their individual skill level
and progress, enhancing immersion and enjoyment.
