# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders is a “fixed shooter” game where the player moves across the screen horizontally and fights off hordes of aliens.
The player must avoid enemy fire while shooting at aliens. The player must act fast against the enemies or else their shields will be gone which makes them more vulnerable to death. The player
only gets three lives to beat the level. To control your spaceship, press the left and
right arrow keys. To shoot, press the spacebar or click. The goal of this game was
to improve our skills within unity and to make a challenging, fun to play game, as
well as implementing a great/smooth UI. 

Space Invaders is jam packed with a gaming experience with various features including
easy and hard modes, score tracking, and enemy aliens to combat. Our final goal was to
make sure a rule-based system, evaluating its variable and quantifiable outcomes,
different values attributed to outcomes, player effort requirement, emotional
attachment elicited from players, and negotiable consequences of gameplay were all
included to make sure the game was complete and most importantly, fun and
challenging for the Player.
