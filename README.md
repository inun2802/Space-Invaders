# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders is a “fixed shooter” game where the player moves across the screen horizontally and fights off hordes of aliens.
The player must avoid enemy fire while shooting at aliens. The player must act fast against the enemies or else
their shields will be gone which makes them more vulnerable to death. The player
only gets three lives to beat the level. To control your spaceship, press the left and
right arrow keys. To shoot, press the spacebar or click. The goal of this game was
to improve our skills within unity and to make a challenging, fun to play game, as
well as implementing a great/smooth UI. This project is also a continuation from
the previous two assignments
